# Tiny Markov

Markov Chains are "a stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends 
only on the state attained in the previous event" ([Oxford Living Dictionaries](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/markov_chain)). 
Markov chains have played a significant role in the history of digital/algorithmic art and music, but very simple examples
are not always easy to find. This Python class aims to implement a very simple Markov chain algorithm from scratch

In the future it is hoped that this project will incorporate a method for outputting the results of one or more Markov chains in
music notation via the [Abjad library](http://abjad.mbrsi.org).
